# benfica-live

## The project

<a href="https://benfica.live" target="_blank">benfica.live</a> is a platform created to gather data that otherwise would be too dispersed.

In this platform, Sport Lisboa e Benfica's fans can share spots to assist to the matches while abroad.

It's built with PHP, using the Laravel framework. We're trying to use the most recent technologies and standards.

Feel free to give us feedback and/or contribute directly to the project! Beit on the frontend or backend.

Some screens of the web app are shared below:
